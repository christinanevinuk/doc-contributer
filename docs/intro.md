# TRG Contributors' Help

This website provides help for contributors to the Technical Reference Guide (TRG). The TRG is the definitive guide on how to build and run services on HMRC's Multi-channel Digital Tax Platform (MDTP).

This website contains four sections. The first section, Organisation, contains an overview of the TRG documentation lifecycle, workflow, and introductions to markdown and Git and GitHub. The second section, Installation, covers how to acquire a GitHub account, and installation of optional software, such as Git clients and code editors. The third section, Writing, contains the TRG documentation standard, optional page templates and guides on writing for the TRG. The last section, Building, covers how to use GitHub or a client to build and deploy the documentation to the TRG repository.



Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**:

```shell
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```shell
cd my-website

npx docusaurus start
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `docs/intro.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and display your changes.
